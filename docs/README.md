1. **ToDo**
    - For basic tasks without any date or time constraints.
    - Format: `[T][X] Read book`

2. **Deadline**
    - To manage tasks with a specific deadline.
    - Format: `[D][X] Finish assignment (by: Nov 30 2023)`

3. **Event**
    - To manage events with a specific start and end date.
    - Format: `[E][ ] Conference (from: Dec 01 2023 to: Dec 02 2023)`

Each task type is displayed with a unique format and status (`[X]` for completed, `[ ]` for incomplete).

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

**Krunch** also features a GUI built with JavaFX. The GUI provides a sleek and user-friendly interface to add and manage tasks.

### Key Components:
1. **User Input Field:**
    - Enter your commands here just like in the CLI.

2. **Send Button:**
    - Click this button or press Enter to process your input.

3. **Dialog Box:**
    - Displays user input on the right and Krunch's witty responses on the left.

## Saving and Loading Tasks

Krunch automates task saving and loading so your tasks persist between runs:

### Saving
- Task data is written to a file named `tasks.txt` in the root directory.
- Each task is saved in a specific format for easy retrieval later.

### Loading
- On startup, **Krunch** retrieves tasks from `tasks.txt`.
- If the file is missing or corrupted, a new empty list is started.
